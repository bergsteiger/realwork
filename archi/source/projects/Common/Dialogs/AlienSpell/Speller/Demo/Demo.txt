SpellDemo is demo program for TSpellChecker component.

To compile the example you must have Delphi VCL Extensions (RX) Library 2.32
installed in your Delphi (see http://rx.unionjv.ru).

SpellDemo is simple rich-text format editor with spelling check 
capability. To check text you should execute next steps:

1) Open any RTF-file in SpellDemo window with File|Open menu.
2) Select desired language from Language menu.
3) Execute spelling check with Edit|Spelling menu.

Also you can press right mouse button on any word in editor window.
When word is misspelled, you can choose alternatives from
popup menu (like MS Word) or start interactive spelling check.

Sorry, I don't include background check capability. I have found
current implementation of TRichEdit is not very convinient for such
things. The problem is to change formatting of text portion in 
RichEdit without selecting it. Another question is how to know
formatting of text without selecting. If anybody knows how to do it
please let me know.
