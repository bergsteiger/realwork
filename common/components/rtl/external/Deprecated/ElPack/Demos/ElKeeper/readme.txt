EldoS Keeper source code.

EldoS Keeper is built using exactly this code. 
Note, that if you get an Access Violation, this doesn't mean, that there is a
problem with some code. This can happen because of the compiler options.

This demo uses freeware third-party component named HexEditor.

This demo is for Delphi 5 and higher only.
