<P>
You found some bug? Before posting e-mail to me, you must be sure in next conditions:
<ul>
<li>Look here to buglist. Maybe is your bug reported by another person previously.
<li>Are you using last release of Synapse?
<li>If bug exists in last release, then try last SynaSnap. In most cases is your bug fixed here.
</ul>

If you still have not known bug, then please, report it. Best place for reporting bugs is synalist e-mail forum. (look to <a href="list.htm">SynaList</a>)<br>
If you have some reason, why you cannot subscribe to Synalist (subscription is totally free by sending special e-mail... not need any accont on Yahhogroups!), then you can send bugreport to my private e-mail <A HREF="mailto:geby@volny.cz">geby@volny.cz</A>.
<br>
However reporting bugs to SynaList is much better, because you can got reply from another person then me.
