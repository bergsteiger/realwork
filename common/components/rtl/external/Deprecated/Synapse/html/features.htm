<p>
This is list of basic features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Synapse is not components, but only classes and routines. Not needed any installation.
<LI>Working under Windows (Delphi or C++Builder) and under Linux (Kylix).
<LI>Support for communicating by Winsock or Libc in blocking mode. Supported is TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW protocols.
<LI>Limited support for non-blocking communication mode.
<LI>Native full SOCKS5 proxy support for TCP and UDP protocols.
<LI>Support for TCP through HTTP proxy tunnel.
<LI>Support for TCP with SSL/TLS by OpenSSL or SSLeay.
<LI>Under Windows you can use any Winsock compatibile DLL. (i.e. with SOCKS5 support, etc.)
<LI>Under Windows may use static or dynamic load of Winsock.
<LI>Support for PING request.
<LI>Support for ASN.1 coding and decoding.
<LI>Support for DNS with many non-standard records.
<LI>Support for character code transoding. Supported charsets are basic ISO codings (ISO-8859-x), windows codings (CP-125x), KOI8-R, CP-895 (Kamenicky), CP-852 (PC-Latin-2) and UNICODE (UCS-4, UCS-2, UTF-7 and UTF-8).
<LI>Support for character replacing during character set transforms. (i.e. for remove diakritics, etc.)
<LI>Support for MIME inline coding and decoding (include character conversion).
<LI>Support for coding and decoding MIME e-mail messages (include character conversion of all supported charsets).
<LI>Support for SMTP and ESMTP protocol. Include AUTH command with LOGIN and CRAM-MD5, SIZE parameter support, ETRN command, VRFY command and with handling of Enhaced Result Codes. SSL/TLS mode also supported.
