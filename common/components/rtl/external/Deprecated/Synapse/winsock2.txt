WINDOWS:

Remember, some of functions or classes work only on Windows with Winsock2!
 (on Win98 and WinNT 4.0 or higher)
If you must use this unit on Win95, download Winsock2 from Microsoft
and distribute it with your application!

In spite of I use Winsock level version 1.1, RAW sockets work in this level only
if Winsock2 is installed on your computer!!!

On WinNT standardly RAW sockets work if program is running under user with
administrators provilegies. To use RAW sockets under another users, you must
create the following registry variable and set its value to DWORD 1:

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Afd\Parameters\DisableRawSecurity

After you change the registry, you need to restart your computer!


LINUX:

Remember, some of functions or classes work only with root rights!
If you need this for another user then root, you must assign root right
for your binary file.
