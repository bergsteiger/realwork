Dream Scripter Installation (additional steps)
============================================================

Please read scripts.txt for details.


============================================================
General Notes/Installation hints
============================================================

* There are many Q&A in FAQs. Please look in help.

* If you work under  C++Builder  and encounter problems with
  Dream Controls try to set "Incremental linking" option off
  and press "Release" button in Options|Project|C++ tab. You
  can also try to turn off "precompiled headers" option.

* Files *_D6.pas, *_D5.pas, *_D4.pas, *_D3.pas, *_C5.pas, 
  *_C4.pas and *_C3.pas  weren't included  in  the registered 
  version  of Dream Scripter.  You can generate them  
  automatically with \UTILS\UNITIMPORTER program.

* If  you want  to use  "External run"  feature  of  Instant
  Report  you need  to build \UTILS\RUNNER project  and copy
  dcrunner.exe to directory where Instant.exe is.

* We used  such Delphi and CPB builds  to compile  our trial
  versions:

   D3  5.83    (service pack 1 and 2 installed)
   D4  5.108   (service pack 1,2 and 3 installed)
   D5  6.18    (service pack 1 installed)
   D6  6.190   (service pack 1 installed)
   C3  3.70    (service pack 1 installed)
   C4  14.11   (service pack 1 installed)
   C5  12.34   (service pack 1 installed)

   If  you  try  to install  our trial  in other  Delphi/CPB
   version  it  may  not  compile.  Registered versions  are
   compatible with any Delphi/CPB build.


============================================================
Installation of the registered version (additional step)
============================================================
>
Starting from V4.1 our registered version installation 
program automatically updates prod.inc file so you need 
to refer to this section only in the case when Delphi 
reports that some files from the Dream package are missing.
<

Before  installation  in  Delphi/CPB   you  need  to  modify
\UNITS\prod.inc file:

   a) If you don't have  "Dream Tree"  product,  comment out
      define
        {$DEFINE DTREE}

   b) If you don't have  "Dream Inspector"  product, comment
      out define
        {$DEFINE DINSPECTOR}

   c) If you don't have  "Dream Designer"  product,  comment
      out define
        {$DEFINE DDESIGNER}

   d) If you don't have  "Dream Scripter"  product,  comment
      out define
        {$DEFINE DSCRIPTER}

   e) If you don't have  "Dream Memo"  product,  comment out
      define
      {$DEFINE DMEMO}

   f) If you don't have  "Dream InfoTree"  product,  comment

      {$DEFINE DINFOTREE}

   g) If you don't have  "Dream InfoTreeGrid"  product,  comment
      out define
