          WELCOME TO EMBARCADERO C++BUILDER RUNTIME LIBRARY SOURCE
          --------------------------------------------------------

  This README contains information on support for the Embarcadero
  C++Builder Runtime Library source code.

  BUILDING THE RTL
  ----------------

  IMPORTANT: In order to build the libraries, the RTL tools directory must be
  present on your path.  These tools are located in the tools subdirectory of
  the directory where the source was copied.  For example, if the RTL source
  tree is in

      C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\18.0\Source\cpprtl
  then
      C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\18.0\Source\cpprtl\tools

  must be added to your path.  A simple way to do this from the command-line
  is to change to the cpprtl directory and type

      set PATH=%CD%\tools;%PATH%

  If the RTL source is located the default installation location you may have
  to start the command-line executable with "Run as administrator" depending
  on your operating system.

  If the RTL was not copied into the C++Builder installation area in the
  SOURCE subdirectory, you will need to set the RTLROOT environment variable
  to point to the location of the RTL source files. For example, if the
  compiler was installed in

      C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\18.0

  and the RTL tree was copied to

      D:\RTLSOURCE

  then you must set the RTLROOT environment variable as follows:

      SET RTLROOT=D:\RTLSOURCE

  or simply change to the directory and run:

      SET RTLROOT=%CD%

  You will additionally need to run RSVARS.BAT which should be on your path
  and is located in the bin subdirectory of RAD Studio.

  To build the RTL, change to the directory into which the source was copied
  and run the BUILD.BAT file.  For example:

      c:\> cd C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\18.0\Source\cpprtl

      C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\18.0\Source\cpprtl> BUILD

  Once the RTL has been built, the new .OBJ, .LIB, .DLL, & .TDS files will be
  located in the SOURCE\CPPRTL\LIB directory.  You should copy all the *.OBJ &
  *.LIB files to your main "RAD Studio\18.0\Lib" directory.  In order to use
  your new DLLs you can either replace the ones in the Windows\System32
  subdirectory or copy them into the directory your program will be running
  from.


  DEBUGGING INFORMATION
  ---------------------

  To build the RTL with debug info enabled, set the environment variable
  DEBUG=1, then proceed with the build as normal.

  Keep in mind that the build process really preforms a "make" re-compiling
  only the OBJs that are out of date.  If you've built copies of the RTL
  previously, then in order to get a complete re-build of the RTL you should
  delete all files and subdirs in RTL\OBJ\WIN32 and RTL\LIB and then re-copy
  those dirs and subdirs from the CD-ROM.

  Alternatively, you can set the environment variable
  RTL_FORCE_FULL_REBUILD=1 then proceed with the build as normal.


  RUNTIME LIBRARY SUPPORT
  -----------------------

  The Embarcadero C++Builder Runtime Library source code is provided for your
  use and modification.

  IMPORTANT: Embarcadero will only provide technical support for the RTL as it
  was shipped.  This means that if you use the source code to re-build the
  RTL, even if you have not modified the source, then no technical support
  is availible from Embarcadero.  Essentially, the RTL sources are provided "as
  is" and you are on your own.

  If you find what you think is a genuine problem in the source code,
  we want to hear about it. Technical Support is available from
  http://support.embarcadero.com


  Windows 64
  ----------

  Initial support for building the Windows 64 RTL requires two
  additional open source tools to be installed.

  Python 2.x (http://www.python.org)

  NASM (http://www.nasm.us)

  Make sure python.exe is in the PATH and copy NASM.EXE to the tools
  subdirectory.

  Passing win64 to the build batchfile will build Windows 64 libraries.
