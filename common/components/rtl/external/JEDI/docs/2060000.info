Add selected Exception dialogs to the Object Repository.

To help using JclDebug exceptional stack tracking in application simple dialog
is provided in jcl\examples\debugExtension\dialog folder. The dialog replaces
standard dialog displayed by VCL or CLX application when an unhandled exception
occurs. It has additional Detailed button showing the stack, list of loaded
modules and other system information. By adding the dialog to the application
exceptional stack tracking code is automatically initialized so you don't have
to care about it. You can also turn on logging to text file by setting the Tag
property of the dialog to '1'. There is also version for CLX (ClxExceptDlg) but
it works on Windows only. These dialogs are intended to be added to Object
Repository.
