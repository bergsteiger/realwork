  (* The closure set of a nonterminal X is the set of all nonterminals Y
     s.t. Y appears as the first symbol in a rightmost derivation from the
     nonterminal X (i.e. X =>+ Y ... in a rightmost derivation). We can
     easily compute closure sets as follows:
     - Initialize the closure set for any nonterminal X to contain all
       nonterminals Y for which there is a rule X : Y ...
     - Now repeatedly pass over the already constructed sets, and for
       any nonterminal Y which has already been added to the closure set
       of some nonterminal X, also include the closure elements of Y in
       the closure set of X.
     The algorithm terminates as soon as no additional symbols have been
     added during the previous pass. *)

  (* The first set of a nonterminal X is the set of all literal symbols
     y s.t. X =>+ y ... in some derivation of the nonterminal X. In
     addition, X is nullable if the empty string can be derived from X.
     Using the first set construction algorithm of Aho/Sethi/Ullman,
     Section 4.4, the first sets and nullable flags are computed as
     follows:

     For any production X -> y1 ... yn, where the yi are grammar symbols,
     add the symbols in the first set of y1 (y1 itself if it is a literal)
     to the first set of X; if y1 is a nullable nonterminal, then proceed
     with y2, etc., until either all yi have been considered or yi is non-
     nullable (or a literal symbol). If all of the yi are nullable (in
     particular, if n=0), then also set nullable[X] to true.

     This procedure is repeated until no more symbols have been added to any
     first set and none of the nullable flags have been changed during the
     previous pass. *)
