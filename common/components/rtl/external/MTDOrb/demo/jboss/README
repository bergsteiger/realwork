SUMMARY

   1. MTDORB/JBoss Interoperability
   2. Prerequisites
   3. Running the examples


1. MTDORB/JBoss Interoperability
   ---------------------------

The subdirectories of this directory contain examples of MTDORB/JBoss 
interoperability.

These examples are in the subdirectories

    txiiop
    exiiop

Each such subdirectory contains an example of EJB, a Delphi client that 
accesses that EJB.

The examples are:

  - txiiop: example from JBoss test suite. Test of CORBA transactions.
  
  - exiiop: example from JBoss test suite. Test of CORBA and java exceptions.

2. Prerequisites
   -------------

 - Sun's JDK (a.k.a. J2SE) 1.4.x, available from java.sun.com

 - JBoss 4.0.0 or higher, available from the JBoss Files page at SourceForge:
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866

 - DUnit, available from the SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dunit

 - Either MTDORB snapshot with date 2004/07/20 (or later) or the upcoming
   MTDORB beta 6


3. Running the examples
   --------------------

Compile all the necessary binaries by typing 'ant' in in root directory of MTDORB.
This will generate a MTDORB client in each example subdirectory. 
Before you can run each client, you need to deploy the EJB jar file in a
JBoss server. To do this, copy the EJB jar file to the "deploy" directory
of the JBoss server. (If you are not familiar with JBoss, read the "NOTE ON 
JBOSS" below.) Once the EJB jar file is deployed (and the JBoss server 
running), simply run the MTDORB client. 

The output of the txiiop client should be:

Call txMandatoryMethod without a UserTransaction
Expected exception: System exception: CORBA::TRANSACTION_REQUIRED
Locality: exception has been received "over the wire"
Completed: NO
Minor code: 0
Begin UserTransaction
Commit UserTransaction
Try to instantiate a UserTransaction
Press Enter

The output of the exiiop client should be:

DUnit / Testing
....IdlException: CORBA user exception IDL:org/jboss/test/excepiiop/interfaces/IdlException:1.0
.JavaException: CORBA user exception IDL:org/jboss/test/excepiiop/interfaces/JavaEx:1.0

Time: 0:00:00.953

OK: 6 tests

Press <RETURN> to continue.

NOTE ON JBOSS: 

JBoss comes with three server configurations: "min", "default", and "all".
Each of them corresponds to a subdirectory of $JBOSS_HOME/server, e.g.: 
$JBOSS_HOME/server/default.

The "default" JBoss configuration does not include IIOP support. To run 
these examples, you should use the "all" configuration:

  - To start the server, go to $JBOSS_HOME/bin and say 

        ./run.sh -c all

    (rather than just `./run.sh', which would start a server with the 
     "default" config)

  - To deploy an EJB, copy the EJB jar file to $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/deploy
    (rather than to $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy).

Alternatively, you can use a customized "iiop" configuration, with ejb/IIOP 
and little else. (This saves machine resources and makes the server startup 
time much shorter.) Creating a customized "iiop" configuration is very easy:

  - Recursively copy  $JBOSS_HOME/server/all to $JBOSS_HOME/server/iiop:

        cd $JBOSS_HOME/server
        cp -a all iiop

  - Remove all subdirectories and files in $JBOSS_HOME/server/iiop,
    EXCEPT the subdirectories jmx-rmi-adaptor.sar and jbossweb-jetty.sar
    and the following files: 
        
        hsqldb-ds.xml
        iiop-service.xml
        jboss-jca.sar
        jboss-local-jdbc.rar
        jboss-xa-jdbc.rar
        transaction-service.xml

  - Use the "iiop" configuration instead of the "all" configuration:

        * Start the server by saying `./run.sh -c iiop' at the $JBOSS/bin
          directory.

        * Deploy an EJB by copying the EJB jar file to the directory
          $JBOSS_HOME/server/iiop/deploy.
