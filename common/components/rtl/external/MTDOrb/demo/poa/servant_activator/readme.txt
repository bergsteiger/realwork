Running this example.

Start the bank server using the command:

	prompt> Server  & 
	(start Server on Windows)
	// make the server run in the background
	
Next, open a user's bank account and query the balance in the account using the command 

	prompt>Client john checking
	
	or
	
	prompt>Client  john savings 
	// uses a default name
	
	or
	
	prompt>Client   // uses a default name and creates a checking account

From the server output, you will see that the servant activator's incarnate() method is invoked for the first client 
request. If you invoke the client again within 15 seconds you will see that the incarnate() method is not called . 
This is because the servant is already active and is in the active object map of the POA. If you wait for 15 seconds 
you should see, from the server output, a message generated by the DeActivator thread when it called 
deactivate_object(). This will remove the servant from the Active Object Map and invoke etherealize() to clean up 
any servant resources. Now if you invoke the client again the incarnate() method gets called to recreate a servant. 
You can also see that the incarnate method is called for two different types of accounts ( checking and savings ) and
the same user can hold 2 different accounts.
