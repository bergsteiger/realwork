# SSL addresses are usual MT_DORB addresses prefixed by 'ssl:', e.g.
#  ssl:inet:0.0:0

# SSL options:
#  -ORBSSLcert <certificate file>
#    .pem file that holds your certificate, defaults to default.pem.
#  -ORBSSLkey <key file>
#    .pem file that holds your key pair, defaults to same file as the
#    certificate file.
#  -ORBSSLcipher <colon separated list of preferred ciphers>
#    cipher(s) that can be used, eg:
#    NULL-MD5     RC4-MD5      EXP-RC4-MD5
#    IDEA-CBC-MD5 RC2-CBC-MD5  EXP-RC2-CBC-MD5
#    DES-CBC-MD5  DES-CBC-SHA  DES-CBC3-MD5
#    DES-CBC3-SHA DES-CFB-M1
#  -ORBSSLverify <verify depth>
#    if specified the peer must supply a valid certificate, otherwise the
#    connection setup will fail. <verify depth> specifies how many
#    hops of the chain of certification authorities should be checked.
#    by default the validity of the peer's certificate is not checked.
#  -ORBSSLCAfile <CA filename>
#    .pem file that holds certificates of CA's
#  -ORBSSLCApath <CA pathname>
#    directory that contains .pem files holding certificates of CA's,
#    defaults to /usr/local/ssl/certs.
#
# the standard OpenSSL environment variables work as well, but the -ORBSSL*
# options override them
#
# the server key file with the servers private key is created by
#   openssl genrsa -out s_key.pem
# a self signed certificate for for server is created by
#   openssl req -days 1000 -new -x509 -key s_key.pem -out s_cert.pem
# the client key and certificate are created analogous.
# see the OpenSSL documentation for details.
