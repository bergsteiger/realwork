MTDORB SSL

Encryption Exportation

The US and other countries have restrictions on export of SSL technology. Because we cannot assure 
where people would download our stuff from, we cannot distribute the SSL code itself. But there are no 
restrictions on import.  Because of this the SSL DLLs are available for download from another 
country.  Legal There may be legal issues with your use of SSL. RSA's main patent has expired and this 
certainly improves the situation.

No Inherent License

MTDORB allows you to do SSL by providing the code, but we do not provide a license to use SSL. 
If you use SSL, it is up to you to make sure that you are legally permitted to use it in the country 
you are in and for your application.
