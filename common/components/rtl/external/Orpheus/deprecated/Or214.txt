This file summarizes changes made between Orpheus versions 2.13 and
2.14.  It is of interest primarily to users who have upgraded from a
previous version.


Changes that may cause compiler errors
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The AsBcd property of the entry fields (and the UseSysTools define in
OVC.INC) were removed to avoid compatibility problems when using
Delphi 3.0 packages and Systools. The change means that projects
that use the AsBcd property won't compile without some minor changes.
The changes should only involve switching to use the AsExtended
property and converting to/from BCD format within your code. The
SysTools StBcd unit provides the routines to accomplish this (BcdExt
and ExtBcd).

The MoveableComponents define in OVC.INC and the functionality that
it provided were removed. If your application depended on run-time
movement of components descending from TOvcBase, you can restore this
behavior by reinserting the removed code from a previous copy of
the OVCBASE.PAS unit and recompiling your application.
