SysTools Test Programs
----------------------

The projects in this directory are some of the projects that we used for
internal testing during the development of SysTools.

These programs are certainly not formal example programs by any stretch of
the imagination -- but we felt that some of our customers might benefit in
some way if we included them with the shipping product.

Most, if not all of the programs are console mode applications.

Most, if not all programs can be compiled in both 16 and 32 bit modes.

The source code (along with any comments in the code) is the only
documentation available for the test programs.

  Enjoy!
