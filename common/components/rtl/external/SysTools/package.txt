TurboPower changes package names with each
new library release. Doing so prevents conflicts
with applications built using run-time packages
from some other version.

If you deploy applications that use run-time packages,
you may need to alter them so that they will use the
current package. C++Builder users will need to do this
regardless of whether or not the application uses
run-time packages (the project makefile contains
a reference to the package library file).

TurboPower's current package naming convention is as follows:

-- The first letter represents one of the TurboPower
     products (e.g., O for Orpheus, S for SysTools)
-- The next three digits are the product version number
     (e.g., 201 for version 2.01)
-- The next two characters are product-specific
-- The last two digits represent the Inprise VCL version
     (e.g., 30 for VCL 3.0)

In Orpheus, the last two digits for Delphi4 are 40 while
they are 41 for C++Builder. While both use VCL 4.0, using
separate packages prevents C++ syntax messages in Delphi
and Delphi syntax in C++Builder.

All run-time packages are digitally signed to insure
their authenticity.

Redistribution of TurboPower packages that are not digitally
signed by TurboPower is not permitted.
