LICENSE AGREEMENT

The GNOSTICE PRODUCT is owned by GNOSTICE and is protected by national copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other applicable intellectual property laws and treaties. The GNOSTICE PRODUCT is licensed, NOT sold.

GRANT OF LICENSE

DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTION: YOU need to purchase a requisite number of DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTIONS from GNOSTICE for YOU to use the GNOSTICE PRODUCT.
YOU need to purchase one DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTION for every person ("AUTHORIZED USER") who will use the GNOSTICE PRODUCT.
An AUTHORIZED USER can install the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on only one computer.
For the sake of flexibility, this license permits the AUTHORIZED USER to install the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on a laptop computer that the AUTHORIZED USER uses if the original installation was on a desktop. Similarly, if the original installation was on a laptop, the AUTHORIZED USER can install and use the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on desktop computer that the AUTHORIZED USER uses. However, with a single DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTION, the AUTHORIZED USER should not install the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on two desktop computers or two laptop computers.
The AUTHORIZED USER can "move" the installation to another computer by first uninstalling the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on the original computer and permanently removing any traces of its existence on that computer and then installing the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on the other computer.
To install and use the GNOSTICE PRODUCT on more computers, YOU need to purchase additional DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTIONS - one for each additional computer.
The AUTHORIZED USER can use the GNOSTICE PRODUCT to develop an unlimited number of "AUTHORIZED APPLICATIONS."
An AUTHORIZED APPLICATION is an independent "end-user" desktop/server/Web application (created by one or more AUTHORIZED USERS) in which the GNOSTICE PRODUCT is used only to provide supplementary functionality. (In plain English: A simple wrapper around one or more of Gnostice component(s) will not qualify as "independent." YOUR end-user application should be a greater work and provide specialized functionality on its own such as (but not limited to) accounting, management, ERP, CRM, or analysis. Gnostice components should be used in end-user applications only to provide additional features.)
End-user applications and software development tools covered under SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE, SDK LICENSE, OEM LICENSE, or STUDENT ACADEMIC LICENSE (described later in this LICENSE AGREEEMENT) do not qualify as an AUTHORIZED APPLICATION.
An AUTHORIZED APPLICATION should use only a compiled run-time version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT. It should not be packaged, deployed or distributed in a way that other software applications or tools can access the functionality of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT bypassing the AUTHORIZED APPLICATION and/or this LICENSE AGREEMENT.
After purchasing the requisite number of DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTIONs, YOU can deploy and/or distribute any number of copies of AUTHORIZED APPLICATIONs without any additional royalties to GNOSTICE.
The grant of license for the original version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT provided by GNOSTICE is perpetual.
SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE: YOU need to purchase a SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE for YOU to deploy/distribute a "SPECIAL APPLICATION."
A SPECIAL APPLICATION is an end-user desktop/server/Web application that is heavily dependent on the functionality provided by the GNOSTICE PRODUCT.
Examples of a SPECIAL APPLICATION would include (but not be limited to) desktop/server/Web-based document viewers, editors, and converters.
YOU need to purchase one SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE for authorizing the deployment and distribution of one SPECIAL APPLICATION.
In addition to the SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE, YOU also need to purchase the requisite number of DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTIONs for AUTHORIZED USERs and additional computers in YOUR organization or business enterprise.
The SPECIAL APPLICATION should use only a compiled run-time version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT. It should not be packaged, deployed or distributed in a way that other software applications or tools can access the functionality of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT, bypassing the SPECIAL APPLICATION and/or this LICENSE AGREEMENT.
The SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE will be limited to all major and minor updates of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT released by GNOSTICE within 12 months of the purchase date. The grant of this license is perpetual.
YOU need to renew the SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE with GNOSTICE if YOU wish to use another major version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT (released after 12 months of purchasing or renewing the SPECIAL APPLICATION license) in the SPECIAL APPLICATION.
SDK LICENSE: YOU need to purchase an SDK LICENSE for YOU to deploy/distribute a "DEVELOPER TOOL."
A DEVELOPER TOOL is a software development tool in which the GNOSTICE PRODUCT is present in a compiled or binary form.
Examples of such a DEVELOPER TOOL would include (but not be limited to) software controls, components, component libraries, and Web APIs.
YOU need to purchase one SDK LICENSE for authorizing the deployment/distribution of one DEVELOPER TOOL.

The SDK LICENSE will be limited to all major and minor updates of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT released by GNOSTICE within 12 months of the purchase date. The grant of this license is perpetual.
The DEVELOPER TOOL should use only a compiled run-time version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT. It should not be packaged, deployed or distributed in a way that other software applications or tools can access the functionality of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT, bypassing the DEVELOPER TOOL or this LICENSE AGREEMENT.
YOU need to renew the SDK LICENSE with GNOSTICE if YOU wish to use another major version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT (released after 12 months of purchasing or renewing the SDK license) in the DEVELOPER TOOL.
SPECIAL SERVER LICENSE: YOU need to purchase a SPECIAL SERVER LICENSE to deploy SPECIAL APPLICATIONS (described under "SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE") or DEVELOPER TOOLS (described under "SDK LICENSE") on a single computer.
The SPECIAL SERVER LICENSE is an alternative to purchasing a SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENSE or an SDK LICENSE.
One SPECIAL SERVER LICENSE is restricted to a single computer, that is, a single OS instance. (In other words, YOU can deploy an unlimited number of SPECIAL APPLICATIONS or DEVELOPER TOOLS on a single computer (a single OS instance) so long as YOU have purchased a SPECIAL SERVER LICENSE for it. To put it another way, YOU need to purchase as many SPECIAL SERVER LICENSES as there are computers (OS instances) where YOU have installed your SPECIAL APPLICATIONS or DEVELOPER TOOLS.)
YOU do not need to purchase individual SPECIAL APPLICATION LICENCES or SDK LICENSES if YOU have purchased adequate number of SPECIAL SERVER LICENSES.
In addition to SPECIAL SERVER LICENSEs, YOU also need to purchase the requisite number of DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTIONS for AUTHORIZED USERS and additional computers in YOUR organization or business enterprise.

All other terms and conditions of this agreement also apply to the modified version of the GNOSTICE PRODUCT.
THOUGHT LEADER/TECHNICAL EVANGELIST LICENSE: If GNOSTICE has provided you a THOUGHT LEADER/TECHNICAL EVANGELIST LICENSE, then YOU can develop, deploy and distribute AUTHORIZED APPLICATIONS (as described earlier) on any number of computers without having to separately acquire a DEVELOPER SUBSCRIPTION. However, YOU should not develop, deploy or distribute a SPECIAL APPLICATION, OEM BUNDLING TOOL, or DEVELOPER TOOL (as described earlier) using the GNOSTICE PRODUCT. (THOUGHT LEADER/TECHNICAL EVANGELIST LICENSE is provided free of cost to select individuals by GNOSTICE. The decision to provide this license is solely at the discretion of GNOSTICE.)
