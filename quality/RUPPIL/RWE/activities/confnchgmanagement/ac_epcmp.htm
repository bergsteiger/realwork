<p>A typical procedure for <a href="../workflow/conf_mgt/co_revno.htm">handling

<h4><a name="Sample Activities for Managing CRs"><font color="#000000" size="3">Sample

<h4><a name="Complete Change Request Form">Complete Change Request Form</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The Change Request Form is <font size="3">a formally submitted artifact that
is used to track all requests (including new features, enhancement requests,
defects, changed requirements, etc.) along with related status information
throughout the project lifecycle. All change history will be maintained with the
CR, including all state changes along with dates and reasons for the change.
This information will be available for any repeat reviews and for final closing.
</font>An example Change Request Form is provided in <a href="../artifact/ar_crqst.htm">Artifact:
Change Requests</a>.</p>
<p>Typical states that a Change Request may pass through are shown in the
following state diagram. (Click anywhere on the diagram to go to a complete
description of <font size="3"><a href="../workflow/conf_mgt/co_revno.htm">Concepts:
Change Request Management</a>)</font></p>
<h4><a name="Sample States and Transitions for a CR">Sample States and
Transitions for a CR</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p align="center"><map name="FPMap1">
<area href="../workflow/conf_mgt/co_revno.htm" shape="rect" coords="2, 1, 548, 460"></map><img src="images/crm_stat.gif" border="0" usemap="#FPMap1" width="549" height="461"></p>
<h4><a name="Analyze the Change Request">Analyze the Change Request</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Once a Change Request is submitted, it is analyzed to ensure that it is
indeed valid, and that appropriate technical and management staff get to review
to the Change Request to assess its validity. Change Requests need to be
reviewed at various levels within the development team. A team leader will often
review and approve Change Requests submitted by any of his staff. If, however,
the scope of a change is beyond the responsibilities of the team it is escalated
for the next level of review. If the impact of the change spans several
different development teams, it is reviewed by the Change Control Board. In the Rational Unified Process,
the Change Control Manager role is used to represent the role of the Change
Control Board (CCB).</p>
<p>Occasionally, a reported system malfunction may be due more to its usage
rather than being linked to system implementation. It might also be the case
that the ‘problem’ has already been reported and is being addressed.</p>
<p>The outcome of the analysis step is either to accept the Change Request or to
reject it on the basis that it is invalid, duplicate or ‘out of scope’ given
the current project vision or mandate.</p>
<h4><a name="Assess Cost of Change Request">Assess Cost of Change Request</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>For valid changes, the next step is to assess and cost the change based on
the impact it has on the overall system, and how easily it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Input from the costing step is provided to the CCB for assessment. The CCB
reviews the Change Request and its impact from a strategic, organizational as
well as the technical point of view. The CCB has to decide whether the Change
Request can be economically justified.</p>
<h4><a name="Apply the Change Request">Apply the Change Request </a><a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Once a Change Request has been approved it can be applied to the software.
The revised software then undergoes quality assurance checks to make sure that
changes were made in accordance with project adopted practices, and that it does
not adversely affect other parts of the existing software.</p>
<p>Once the changes have been made the new version of the software is verified
in a test build of the product and then incorporated into and verified in a ‘release’
version of the overall software.</p>
<h4><a name="Maintain the Change History">Maintain the Change History</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Request Process"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>As software changes are made, it is important that a record of all of the
changes is maintained.</p>
<p>An effective way to maintain a change history is at the beginning of each
software component, and within the change requests.</p>
<p>An example of the kind of change data to maintain in a component header could
be the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <u>
  <p>Modification History</u></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Version Modifier Date Change Reason</p>
  <p>1.1 Bruce Bogtrotter 98.05.01 Test Ranges CR#232</p>
  <p>1.2 Maria Mussolini 98.06.02 Requirements CR#454</p>
</blockquote>

        and review, and are documented for tracking and auditing purposes.</li>

<p>The CCB meets on a regular, and as required basis.</p>
<p>The basic tasks of the CCB are to declare product baselines, and review
changes to the baseline, and approve, disapprove, or defer their implementation.</p>
<h4><a name="Select Members">Select Members </a><a href="#Establish the Change Control Board"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The purpose of this step is to set up a CCB that consists of the ‘right
people’ with real authority amongst their peers, and sufficient expertise to
avert unwise or costly change proposals. The CCB needs to be composed of
representatives from all affected organizations or stakeholders such as:
<ul>
  <li>Users</li>
  <li>Developers</li>
  <li>Test Group</li>
  <li>Project Management</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Appoint CCB Chair">Appoint CCB Chair</a> <a href="#Establish the Change Control Board"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The chair of the CCB must be from the Project Management office. The chair
should be able to unambiguously resolve conflicts within the team, and enforce
the team’s decisions on the project.</p>
<p>Decisions by the CCB should be reached by consensus whenever possible. The
group dynamic reflects the cooperative nature of the development project. The
role of the chair is to nurture this cooperative vision, and take unilateral
action if necessary.</p>
<h4><a name="Meet to Assess Change Proposals">Meet to Assess Change Proposals</a>
<a href="#Establish the Change Control Board"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The CCB must meet on a regular, and an as required, basis to ensure that
Change Proposals are reviewed and dispositioned in a timely manner. The
development team must see this group as a reliable body for the resolution of
issues that could otherwise deadlock progress on the project.</p>

<p>Input to this step is the list of artifacts to be developed during the course
of the project.</p>
<p>Members of staff need to review product related artifacts to decide on
whether they meet defined project quality standards to be passed on to the next
stage of development. If a product fails a review, it is subject to re-work,
change and re-review.</p>
<p>For a review to be ‘effective’ the product has to be assessed by the
right people who understand the scope and impact of a proposed change or
enhancement. Furthermore, reviews need to be ‘cost effective’ such that
staff time of key implementers and integrators is not being wasted on yielding
‘low impact’ defects.</p>
<p>Members of staff who need to be involved in a review are representatives from
the ‘product’ producer, recipient and management sides. This is to ensure
that all stakeholders with a vested interest in the product quality can decide
on whether the product can progress to the next level of development.</p>
<p>In team environment, the overall project is broken down into work packages.
Work packages are allocated to responsible individuals for implementation and
integration. For example, the overall system is divided into subsystems, and
then into individual packages. Team members responsible for implementing a package
need to be sure that their changes are reviewed by peers within the subsystem,
and anyone else in other subsystems who may be impacted by the changes.</p>
<p>The review and change notification principle is to communicate to peers and
team leaders, and recipients of the proposed changes, and to give them an
opportunity to review and comment on the proposals.</p>
